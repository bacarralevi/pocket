# üí∞ Budget Tracker

Pocket is a Django-based web app built using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to log in, set budgets, record transactions, and view them with filter and sort options. 
The UI is clean and fully responsive across devices, including mobile. 
We used only basic web technologies (no advanced frameworks), 
and the project is structured using Django‚Äôs MVC pattern. 
A virtual environment (venv) is used for dependency management, 
and all frontend assets are organized under the static and templates folders.
